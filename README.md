# proof-of-help
Consensus protocol project
"Proof of Help" is a consensus protocol focused on reducing inequality. In Proof of Help, the authority to approve transactions is granted to nodes proportionally based on the amount of tokens they choose to donate to valuable projects.
Protocols based on Proof of Help could accept donations using a dedicated token, but they can theoretically function with existing ones, such as cryptocurrencies or cryptoassets. While the choice of a native token is not inherently embedded in the logical structure of Proof of Help, it could be the one that better reflects the inner nature of the protocol. If the core idea of Proof of Help is to reduce inequalities, it should minimize the use of tokens associated with Proof of Stake or Proof of Work, which, in theory, could exacerbate such inequalities. 
In Proof of Help protocols (PoHp), nodes should contribute a certain amount of tokens to a worthy project to obtain the power to validate transactions. The validation process allows nodes to receive a reward through fees or the emission of new tokens.
A PoHp is necessarily backed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) responsible for selecting "worthy projects." The PoH DAO should have a complexity that aligns with the intricacies of the market in which the blockchain operates. The PoH DAO selects projects funded (with the token) by donors who become validators, receiving a validation Token.
